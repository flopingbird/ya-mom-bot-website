	<h1 class="ex1">Why Do I have these posts?</h1>
	<p class="ex1">As you can assume running a bot doesnt relly turn that much of a profit, so I gotta make money some how right? And since I have a soul and I'm not super famous the easiest way to acheive this is by taking donations and trying to run ads on website. Now, you may be wondering why do I have to have these posts for ads to be ran on this website, well, google adsense is just a little too funny. And since my website "lacks content" (no way) it wont run ads. And the simpliest way to add content is through this, so hopefully I get ads after this.</p>
