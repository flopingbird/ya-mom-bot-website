	<h1 class="ex1">How did ya mom bot come to be?</h1>
	<p class="ex1">While the creation of the universe cannot be pinpointed to an exact date something of equal value can, ya mom bot. Like most people, you probably have never even considered the origin story of this godsend. Well, I am here to fulfill the request nobody ever made.</p>
	<p class="ex1">Early 2020, Skyblock Hypixel end lobby. I was bored and did any reasonable thing an average hypixel player would do, annoy people! "i haven't gotten a special zealot in years", nobody acknowledged this poor man, so I took an opportunity I would never regret. "ya mom hasn't had a special zealot in years!". And then, then I realized I had something great. This guy, his response, my god, it was something. Then, then I started. Every message sent in that lobby, I ya mom'ified, by hand. Soon, I realized I had found something great, the absolute anger and hate other people exhibit due to the two words "ya mom". So I decided to take it to the next scale, I just started saying it in regular conversation. Oh? You're clinically depressed? "Ya mom is clinically depressed!" After I realized the feeling of pain was universal, I decided I had to immortalize it. I started to brainstorm, how? How does somebody do this? How do you make a simple shitpost into something that lasts forever. First, I thought back to the beginning, Minecraft! Of course, I can code a mod to auto respond to messages! But before I began the process a friend started to develope a bot, a discord bot. And I had an epiphany.</p>
	<p class="ex1">August 12th 2020 I started development, now, I wont harp on the code I wrote, because it was shit. But the first "release" of ya mom bot was, to put it simply, a fail. For some god awful reason top.gg declined my application! Wow! What criminals! (not like I didnt write anything for the description except the letter "a" for 200 times) But beside the point, I got a few friends to install it, and that was it, no hosting solution, no way to get it out there, and DEFINITELY no optimization. And then, it died.</p>
	<p class="ex1">So I forgot to mention something important, ya mom bot was the first piece of javascript code I ever wrote. So, of course it was bad code. However, on winter break of 2020 I decided to rewrite it, with more experience since my first time I thought it would be a good idea. It was, with a new feature, the grammar thingy (very technical i know). So I decided to maybe try to get it into top.gg, to my surprise they accepted it. And so began the growth. and the final part of this amazing story. The hosting. I am EXTREMELY unqualified to talk about discord bots or javascript. However, I knew a thing or two about hosting, so, I bought a raspberry pi, worked for the first 3 months of this bot. Until I broke it, so I switched to AWS. And thats the entire story.</p>
